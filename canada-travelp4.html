            <h2 class="section-heading">Final steps and Landing in Canada</h2>

            <p align="justify">One fine day will come where you will get an email that you have a new message in your CIC account, and this message will make you very happy. This message will state that your Permanent Residency is approved and there is nothing stopping you from living a peaceful and better life in Canada.</p>

            <h3>Now the process has two final steps you need to complete</h3>
            <p align="justify"><h4>First part-</h4></p>
            <p align="justify">The message will state that you have to send the following to the address they state within 14 days-
            <p align="justify"><b>1. Passport-</b> <br />You will send your passport(not a photocopy) to Canada Immigration. You have to make sure you have atleast 2 continous blank pages on your passport and your passport does not expire within 3 months. If it does not satisfy the criteria, check out your local embassy and they can help you with an updated passport. If you send an updated passport, make sure you send your old passport as well.
            Say goodbye to your passport for two to six weeks. So do not plan on any foreign trips during this time. If you are in an emergency and are outside you residence country or have a trip planned, reach out to Canada Immigration right away. They are very mindful and sympathetic towards every case and consider every case unique.</p>
            <p align="justify"><b>2. Photos- </b><br /> You will have to get two photos taken from a place which can give you a stamp on the back of the photo to validate it.
            The person taking the photo should stamp the shop's/institution's stamp on the back of the photo, along with the date. You will write your name above it.
            This photo needs to be exactly as specified as it can lead to you having to take another photo and mailing it as they can choose to ask you for another set of photos even if it misses their criteria by a couple of millimeters. This has happened to my friend, who had to send a total of 4 sets(8 photos) as there was a mistake in the first, second and third set. They need you to be very specific to what they want.
            For an exact requirements set, please refer to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/photospecs-e.pdf">this website</a>
          </p>
          <p align="justify"><b>3. Prepaid return mail- </b><br /> You will have to send a prepaid return mail which they will use to send your passport back to you. Don't be stingy and buy the 1 day or 2 day day prepaid mail service with tracking as you do not want to go through all the processes because you wanted to save a couple bucks and lost your passport.
          The process will drive you crazy and you do not want that</p>

          <p align="justify"><h4>Second part-</h4></p>
          <p align="justify">Once you receive the package back, it will have two things in it, one is your passport with a visa stamped on it and the other will be two COPR letters which is basically a proof of you need to carry on the border.
            <p><b>LANDING IN CANADA</b></p>
            <p align="justify">Do not be Confused by the word landing. You can arrive by air or by road, it does not matter. You will have to come to Canada before 1 year from your medical test ot within 6 months from your passport stamping, whichever is earlier.
              You can take a flight to any major airport in Canada and arrive with the documents I will list below.
              You can also come by car via one of the many entry points at the US-Canada border if you are traveling north from the US and have a car under your name.
              Now you need to carry the following documents without fail
              <br /><b>1. Passport
              <br />2. COPR documents
              <br />3. Financial documents that state you have enough money in the bank account</b>(atleast the amount you had stated in your forms before)
          <b>    <br />4. A list of your belongings that you would like to declare</b>(anything that is more than 2000 CAD)
            </b>  <br />Following is a list optional documents but try to carry them with you if possible
          <b>    <br />5. Copy of Medical certificates
              <br />6. Degree evealuation and transcripts
              <br />7. Police Certificate
              <br />8. Your vehicle documentation</b>(if you arrive by road and would like to take your vehicle permanently to Canada. Good thing to note here is that you should have your car fully paid off)
             <p align="justify">Be calm and cheerful. The Immigration officers are very nice and polite. I was amazed by their friendliness and their helpfulness. They will ask you to give them all the documents. They will also ask you about where you plan to live in Canada and what will be your address.
              If you have a place decided where you will live for the next three months atleast, then give that address as you will receive you PR cards in the mail at this address in 2 months time approximately. If you have a family or friends in Canada, then give their address as they will receive the PR cards in the mail and they can pass it on to you.
            Be careful as if you do not have family or friends in Canada, then you need to make ample arrangements for 3-4 months stay before reaching as you cannot get a PR card without it and cannot have an address.
          A good thing here is that if you have decided on a temporary place for  week or so and then will look for housing, then provide this temporary address to start with and then you can notify CIC of a change of address to get your PR cards.</p>
          <p align="justify">The Immigration officer will ask you a few basic questions- how much money do you have, where do you plan to stay and what is your occupation. Be confident as these immigration officers are helping you to come to Canada. Once verything is set, they will take your COPR document and stamp it with the current date. They will say those beautiful words that you have been waiting for"Welcome to Canada. You are now a Permanent Resident of Canada."
          With a smile and weeks and months of preparation and documentation, you will become a Permanent Resident of Canada. Even though this seems very tedious, it is process that will change your life. </p>
          <p align="justify">Post landing in Canada and getting your Permanent Residency, visit a Service Canada office to get your Social Insurance Number(SIN). It is a free process and will be used by you to legally get a job in Canada. You can look up for a center or apply by mail, depending upon your preference.
            You can look for a center near you or more information about applying by mail <a href"https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin/apply.html">here</a>
            <p align="justify"> <h3>Congratulations and wishing you a pleasant stay in Canada. Please feel to<a href="contact.html"><u> contact me</u> </a>if you have any questions at all</h3></p>
