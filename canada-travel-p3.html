            <h2 class="section-heading">After receiving the Invitation to Apply(ITA)</h2>

            <p align="justify">I hope you come to the happy stage where you have received an Invitation to Apply and are just small yet tedious steps away from becoming a Canadian Permanent Resident</p>

            <p align="justify"><h3>Now that you received an ITA, you will have to submit all the paperwork electronically and are now going to make sure everything is uploaded without missing any documents</h3>
            </p>
            <p align="justify"> You are given an option to accept the ITA, if you are ready and will not have paperwork problems, or you can choose to deny the ITA and re-enter the pool.
              Make sure you have all the neccesary paperwork as it important that you finish this within 90 days from receiving ITA.(it was 6 months before but they reduced it back to 3 months. Hopefully, it will go back to 6 months to be a little more flexible for the applicants).
            <p align="justify"><h4>The paperwork to upload includes but is not limited to- </h4>
            </p>
            <p align="justify"><b>1. Passport- </b><br />You will upload a PDF of your passport with the first and last page as well as all the stamped pages.
              Make sure everything is in 1 pdf and all the pages are clearly scanned. If you have seperate scans and want to put them together, a website like <a href="https://www.ilovepdf.com">ILovePDF</a> can help you organize your documents.
              This is a very good website to manage your other pdfs as well. You can cut or merge pdfs which will help you put everything in 1 pdf.
            </p>
            <p align="justify"><b>2. Education evaluation and degree transcripts-</b> <br />You will do the same as you did above- merge all your documents into 1 pdf.
              The important documents here are the evaluation sent by an accrefiated institution which you had done at the beginning of this process.
              You will add your transcripts, if can obtain them. Along with this, add your degree certificates.
            </p>

            <p align="justify"><b>3. Police verification Certificate- </b><br />This is one of the documents that you will require some time to obtain.
              If you are not in your home country, then you will have to contact your embassy to get you a police clearance certificate.
              You can be pro active and start working towards this certificate when you put in the express entry application.
              This will be for all the places that you have been for more than 6 months at one time. For how to obtain police clearance certificate, visit <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/police-certificates/how.html">this website.</a>
              Your history can affect your candidacy. So, having a clean certificate always helps. Minor traffic violations and parking tickets don't affect this certificate.
              PRO TIP:If you need a police verification certificate from the US Department of Homeland Security, then go for the online process instead of the mail process as the online process will be done in a few days and you can get the result online which you can download and print.
              This is better than the mail process which can take more than 3 months
            </p>

            <p align="justify"><b>4. Work Experience certificates- </b><br /> You will have to get this from your current employer as well as you previous employers. If you had declared any employers in your application, it is necessary to get a certificate from them.
              The certificate is not very different from the generic experience certificates you get from your employer, but you need to make sure a few things are on the certificate. Thes things are length of your employment including start date and end date(if it is a previous employer), work undertaken(this can be brief and does not need to be explained fully), work ethic and return number or email address if they need to verify your employment. In very rare cases they will reach out to your employer but it is better to let them know about it ahead of time.
            </p>

            <p align="justify"><b>5. Medical Certificates- </b><br /> You will have to get a full examination done by a doctor affiliated with Canada Immigration. You will find a doctor by searching <a href="https://secure.cic.gc.ca/pp-md/pp-list.aspx">from their panel here.</a> Your primary care physician or family doctor cannot do this checkup unless he is on the panel.
            <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-permanent-residents.html#who">  This wepage </a> will give you an idea on what to expect during the medical exam.
            It should cost you between 300-400$ depending upon the doctor you choose. These panel doctors are extremely busy and you need to plan accordingly to get a medical check done. So plan on getting an appointment 15 days from they day you are looking. People usually do this the last-mainly because this medical test will have an expiry date and will be valid for a year. So, you will get a year from the date of your exam to land in Canada.
            Also, this can affect your application if some serious medical conditions surface. This is because Canada does not want you to come in with medical conditions that you will want treatment for(and that too free!!)
          </p>

          <p align="justify"><b>6. Photos-</b> <br /> You will have to get a digital photo taken with a white background. This needs to be clear and will have you looking directly into the camera with no facial expression. DO NOT smile or wink or try to show your funny face. Something like this should not result in your disqualification.
          Make sure that you have 80% face coverage in your photo.
          </p>
          <p align="justify"><b>7. Place of Interest and Provincial nomination-</b><br />
            If you are one of the few people who applied for provincial nomination, then you will have to upload a copy of receipt of provincial nomination.
            You are now bound to the territory you received a nomination from. <br />For people with no nomination, here you will select one place of choice which you would like to live in once you come to Canada.
            Here you can select only one territory so be wise.
            PRO TIP: Choose Alberta or Saskatchewan as they are less inhabited places and it is seen that people choosing these territories get their application processed faster than people choosing Ontario or British Columbia.
            You are not obliged to live in the same state you mentioned in the form, it is just a preference. </p>
          <p align="justify"><h4>Once you have successfully uploaded all the paperwork, you will get a link to finalize the application at the bottom of your screen. You will click Continue and pay the fees.
          </h4>PRO TIP: Pay the combined fees as that does help to expedite the process as they do not have to wait to come back to you for additional payment and reduces the wait times in the future</h4></p>
